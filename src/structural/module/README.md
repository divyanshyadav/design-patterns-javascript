## Module Pattern

As the codebase grow, to make it maintainable and separate we can use module pattern.

## Pros

-   Allows to split code into smaller reusable pieces
-   Prevent private values to be expose to the outer world if not exported explicitly. Which provides encapsulation
-   Reduces the risk of name collisions as the values are not available in the global scope
